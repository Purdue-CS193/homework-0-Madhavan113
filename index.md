## About Me
Hi, my name is Madhavan Prasanna, and I'm a freshman at Purdue University. I'm currently majoring in Data Science!

## My Projects
- **Project 1:** My first project is a simple research project, focused on utilizing cointegrating tests to see if there exists causality between macroeconomic indicators such as inflation/interest rates with the S&P 500. I utilized 2 tests, Granger Causality test, and Principle Component Analysis which was combined with Johannson Cointegration Test.
- **Project 2:** My second project is also a simple research project, this was a more "fun" project where I wanted to see if Bitcoin has price cyclicality as preached by internet crypto gurus. For this test, I utilized a KNN neural network combined with Principle Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality. I also experimented with ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) as well as Prophet.
